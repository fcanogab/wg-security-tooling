# OSSF Security Tooling

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions related to the group's mission and charter.

## Objective

Our mission is to provide the best security tools for open source developers
and make them universally accessible. We want to create a space where members
can collaborate together to improve upon existing security tooling and develop
new ones to suit the needs of the broader open source community.

## Vision

Our vision is to improve the perception of security in open source software.

# Governance

The [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md) outlines the scope and governance of our group activities.

### CodeQL rules

### Verification of findings initiative
* One way of helping open source projects is analyzing them with these security tools. However, please, never send just the output of a security tool to an open source maintainer. The will need to invest a lot of time just to understand and triage the potential vulnerability. If you really want to help, try to follow this [guidelines](https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling/publications/guidelines.md).
