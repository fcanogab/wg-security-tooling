# Verification of Findings initiative

## Mission

To provide resources that help optimize the time invested by open source projects analyzing and triaging security vulnerabilities.

Key ideas:

* Patch > Reproducer > Specific, good quality information >>>>>>> Raw data (the output of a tool).
* Don't send the raw output of a tool to an open source project.
* Only based on version numbers cannot be said if a package is patched or not (see backporting).
* Security tools have false positives.

## Publications

* [Guidelines](https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling/publications/guidelines.md) to review before reporting a security vulnerability to an open source project.
